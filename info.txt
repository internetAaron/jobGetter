JobGetter

JobGetter Cover Letter is a simple HTML page that will blow your potential employer away and separate you from the other applicants!  It's easy to customize to each position that you apply for.


Customizing JobGetter Text

JobGetter was built with simple HTML/CSS.  If your not familiar with HTML, don't worry you'll be just fine.  It might take you a little longer but it's totally doable.  Most of the elements on the page are just editing text, so find what text you are wanting to change and replace it with your own.  It's that easy.


Changing JobGetter Portfolio Images

This will take a little more work but it's not hard.  
	- First you will want to find 3 projects you'd like to show.  
	- Take a screenshot of each.
	- Make a thumbnail for each that is 280px wide by 180px high.
	- Make the enlarged screenshot image.  Note: It's best to keep this image no wider than 960w and 700h.
	- Now put all six images in your img/portfolio directory.
	- Just like up the images in the portfolio section and your good to go.
If you don't want to have portfolio images just delete this section.


Change the footer
	
	Don't forget to link your resume and add your own picture to the footer.
		- To change your picture in the footer follow the same directions that you did when changing the portfolio images.
